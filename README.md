### Add new Layout Blocks

New layout blocks can easily be added:

- Add a file to /src/collections/blocks ( for Payload Admin Backend ) and add the fields. See Payload Docs: [https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/overview](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/overview)
- Import it to Pages.ts and add it to CollectionConfig to blocks.
- Create a new file for your Block: /src/components/blocks
- Import it to /src/components/blocks/blocks.tsx

Now you can use your new block for the page layouts.
